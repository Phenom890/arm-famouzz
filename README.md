This project is the result of a tutorials from justdjango and Nilesh Borateng mixed together.
I used mdbootstrap ecommerce template for most of the project and some templates from Nilesh Borateng's ecommerce tutorial.
This is an ecommerce project I created for my brother who is a fashion designer so his customers can buy from him at the comfort of their homes and have it delivered.
This is my first almost solo project and so please if you find any bug in the code, plese create an issue so i can review it.
Also, I welcome any ideas on how to enhance this project so you can make a pull request and I will gladly merge it.
